## Summary

Survey of 120 projects considered European Open Science Infrastructure (OSI) from 28 countries. A secondary survey also collected input from executives, senior management, IT specialists, researchers, and contributors.


Characteristics of OSI

- Goals and purpose of OSI
- Target audience
- Technical openness
- Compliance with specific open standards and principles
- Governance
- Financial sustainability

## Results

Focus on access (p.3)

> The survey found that OSIs are predominantly motivated by their ambition to further the vision of Open Access (OA) and Open Science (OS) by making research and knowledge openly and widely available (72 out of 120).

Discovery and search services & archiving and preservation of key areas of OSI (p.3):

> The most common areas which OSIs support in the research lifecycle were (i) enabling discovery and search services and (ii) providing storage for archiving and/or digital preservation.

Identification of key elements within OSI ecosystem (p.3):

> Aggregation & indexing, search, storage, identity (e.g. ORCID) and persistent identifiers are central to the OSI ecosystem since they are referred to by many.
