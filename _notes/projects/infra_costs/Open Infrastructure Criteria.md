# Criteria for Open Infrastructure

This document provides a breakdown of concrete questions and criteria for open infrastructure projects in the scholarly space. See [[Defining Open Infrastructure]] for a more detailed discussion of how we conceptualize *open infrastructure*. We want to acknowledge that the following definitions and conceptualizations come from particular perspectives with their own privileged histories and trajectories.

> “*Definitions belong to the definers, not the defined.*” Toni Morrison, Beloved

## 3+1 Dimensions of OI

What is an open infrastructure project and what isn't? An seemingly innocent questions that quickly leads to the common hodgepodge of conflicting definitions deriving from a multitude of worldviews, cultures & economies, missions & goals, and dreams & realities across the globe. The answer to the question of what counts as *open infrastructure*, thus, will always depend on the particulars of who is asking and who is answering.

To overcome this challenge, or at least acknowledge its complexity, we propose to re-consider the question as one of degrees and relationality. How open and how "infrastructural" does a project enter into the relation with its scholarly community of users? Within that conceptual and methodological framework, we propose 3+1 analytic dimensions to asses open scholarly infrastructure projects:

1. *Infrastructureness*. The infrastructure-like characteristics of a project independent of their current implementation, scope, reach or scale.
2. *Scholarlyness*. The relevance to scholarly activities avoiding preconceived notions of what "proper science" ought to look like and including research-related areas such as education or citizen science.
3. *Openness*. Openness conceived as more than open licenses or transparency of operations. We center the idea of openness as a radical tool for change and betterment of our communities.
4. *Transformative influence*. To foster and enable change, we want to actively seek out projects projects that shine light on or operate in the fringes of infrastructures, scholarship, and openness for the betterment of the absent and silenced voices.

The first three dimensions should be understood as orthonogal, meaning that a project can be more or less infrastructural, tightly or loosely connected to scholarship, and open or closed, while, the transformative influece of a project can be traced across all of the previous three dimensions.

In what follows, we break down each dimension into sub-categories derived from the amazing work of others before us such as [[infrastructure#Dimensions of infrastructure \| Leigh Star's dimensions of infractures]] and the [[Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure]] (POSI). Concepts from both frameworks have been remixed[^1] and restructured to fit into and further structure the 3+1 dimensions of open infrastructures.

[^1]: From Star's framework, we are leaving out *built on an installed base*, *becomes visible upon breakdown*, *is fixed in modular increments, not all at once or globally* as properties that do not provide specific value in the assessment of individual projects, however, they are still important for an inclusive and future-oriented funders' perspective on infrastructure. In the case of POSI, certain more concrete principles such as the *creation of a contingency fund* or general support of the notion of *surplos generation* are left out in order to be receptive towards other radically different models of sustainability.

### [infra]structureness

Infrastructure has become an important *buzz*word for research institutions, funders, and policy-makers, and scholars around the world. While we typically think of the global digital technologies that scholarship operates on, many more tools and services can be conceived to display [[infrastructure#Dimensions of infrastructure \| infrastructure-like characteristics]]. Due to their complex nature, infrastructures are rarely imagined and created in their final form; rather an incremental and modular chain of intentional and emergent changes lead to those structures that we typically refer to as infrastructure. Thus, in order to include the many potentials and imaginatives in the landscape of scholarly infrastructures, we propose to capture the *infrastructureness* of a project rather than making binary cuts that warrant the inclusion or exclusion from potential funding streams. 

[[Example: The road network as a classic example of public, physical infrastructure might have initially hindered the understanding of taxi networks (and more recently the addition of platforms for on-demand gig economy) as infrastructures.::rmn]]

That is to say, instead of attempting to categorize these projects on their current (or early) technical implementations, we propose to investigate how they relate to the end-user, communities of practice, and other surrounding (infra)structures.

- *Visibility*
	- Is the project visible to the end-user in the scholarly community?
- *Embeddedness*
	- Is the project built-on and integrally connected to other systems and practices?
- *Standardization*
	- Does the project plug into other technical or social systems in standardized ways?

### [schol]arlyness

*To-do & elaborate*: Write text that describes that scholarship is another contentious concept that we attempt to disentagle. It is more than the usual categerization with the [[scholarly communication#Research Lifecycle \| research lifecycle]] might indicate. We are explicitly also considering other related practices and activities such as learning and training in scholarship and other efforts that don't directly tie into the academy (e.g. citizen science).

[[Example: Just because commercial freight trains run on the same tracks as passenger trains it doesn't make the rail network either industrial or civic infrastructure.::rmn]]

- *Learned as membership*
	- Is the use of the project learned as part of the membership of a scholarly community?
- *Conventions of practice*
	- Is the infrastructure integral to parts of scholarly practices?
	- Which part of the research cycle or scholarship is the infrastructure associated with?

### [open]ness

*To-do & elaborate*: The understaning of openess as a focus on community over the individualistic committment to notions of freedom as in licenses that enable re-use. Connect to the principlies of scholarly infrastructure that provide a good framework for open practices and governance structures that ensure community value.

[[Example: Just because commercial freight trains run on the same tracks as passenger trains it doesn't make the rail network either industrial or civic infrastructure.::rmn]]

- *Governance*
	- Is the project stake-holder governed?
	- Are operations transparent?
	- Does the project operate a non-discriminatory membership model?
- *Sustainability*
	- Is the infrastructure operated on a non-profit model?
	- Is the infrastructure operated mission-driven and community measured? 
	- Does the infrastructure address financial and operational needs regardin project time and infratructure time?
- *Community insurance*
	- Does the infrastructure use open licenses for their code and data?
	- Does the infrastructure ensure accessibility (not only availability) of code and data?
	- Does the project avoid enforcing patents?

### [transf]ormative

*To-do & elaborate*: The practice of "responsible agency" by considering the histories and trajectories of infrastructures in their local, social settings and especially looking for the absences and silences of those communities that were excluded. 

We also understand openness as a "radical practice" with the potential to bring about positive change and social justice. Open infrastructures resonate and harmonize with a "polyphony of perspectives" which can only be achieved by an active effort to look beyond the established structures and listening to the voices of the otherwise suppressed.

Often, in the terms of infrastructures, these efforts translate into the resolving of spatial, temporal, and social tensions (Star also calls these tensions of *reach and scope*). We are, thus, specifically looking for projects which navigate and find innovative solutions to the local/global, short-term/long-term, social/technical, western/non-western tensions within the scholarly space.

[[Example: Building a network of charging ports for electric vehicles rather than extending the coverage of gas stations.::rmn]]

- *Infrastructureness*
	- does the project develop new standards and/or question established ones?
- *Scholarlyness*
	- Does the project support non-western epistemologies?
	- Does the project support non-English speaking communities?
	- Does the project support knowledge creation outside of academic circles?
	- Does the project support non-hegemonic perspectives on gender, sex, ethnicity, and race?
- *Openness*
	- Does the project promote or enable open access?
	- Does the project project use decentralized modes of governance and sustainabilty such as a worker cooperative?
