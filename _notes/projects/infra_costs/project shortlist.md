## Gaps

### Education and learning

Education is already often suffers at the cost of research within academia. It is however notable that the largest learning management systems (LMSs) are in the hands of commercial entities while also being FOSS (Moodle, Canvas).

### Bias towards visible infrastructure

Publishing platforms take a central role in the current shortlist.

It might be worth to consider highlighting and centering some of the standards and protocols undergirding those platforms, e.g., JATS & SciELO Publishing Schema or .nb (notebook document format)
