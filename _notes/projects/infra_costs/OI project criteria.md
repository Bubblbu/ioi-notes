# OI project criteria

See [[Defining OI]] for a high-level overview of what counts as open infrastructure.

We are using [[infrastructure#Dimensions of infrastructure \| Star's dimensions of infractures]] and the [[Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure]] (POSI) as frameworks for the definition of the following criteria.

Concepts from both frameworks are remixed[^1] into four broader guiding characteristics of open infrastructure projects in the scholarly space:

[^1]: From Star's framework, we are leaving out *Built on an installed base*, *Becomes visible upon breakdown*, *Is fixed in modular increments, not all at once or globally* as properties that do not provide specific value in the assessment of individual projects, however, they are still important for the funders' perspective. In the case of POSI, ...

*Infastructureness.* Infrastructures appear in relation to a person in varying degrees.

> One person’s infrastructure is another’s brick wall, or in some cases, one person’s brick wall is another’s object of demolition.

*Scholarlyness.* What counts as scholarship and not is contentious and crucial to questions of social justice. Just because commercial freight trains run on the same tracks as passenger trains it doesn't make the rail network either industrial or civic.

> One person’s infrastructure is another’s brick wall, or in some cases, one person’s brick wall is another’s object of demolition.

*Openness.* What counts as scholarship and not is contentious and crucial to questions of social justice. Just because commercial freight trains run on the same tracks as passenger trains it doesn't make the rail network either industrial or civic.

> One person’s infrastructure is another’s brick wall, or in some cases, one person’s brick wall is another’s object of demolition.

*Transformative influence.* What counts as scholarship and not is contentious and crucial to questions of social justice. Just because commercial freight trains run on the same tracks as passenger trains it doesn't make the rail network either industrial or civic.

## Infrastructureness

This is about the infrastructury qualities.

### Transparency

- Transparency

### Embeddeddness

- Embedded

### Embodiment of standards

- Standards are involved

## Scholarlyness

This is about the scholarlyness.

### Learned as part of membership

Learned as part of membership of a scholarly community.

### Conventions of practice

Linked to scholarly conventions of practice.

## Openness


### Governance

- stakeholder governance
- transparency of operations
- non-discriminatory membership

### Sustainability

- Non-profit
- Mission-driven and community measured
- Project time vs infratructure time

### Community Insurance

- Accessible and available source code
- Accessible and available data
- Patent non-assertion

## Transformative Influence

The practice of "responsible agency" by considering the histories and trajectories of infrastructures in their local, social settings and especially looking for the absences and silences of those communities that were excluded.

We also understand openness as a "radical practice" with the potential to bring about positive change and social justice. Rather than Open infrastructures resonate and harmonize with a "polyphony of perspectives" while

### Reach and scope

Attempting to resolve the tension of the local/global, social/technical, project/infrastructure time.

- Absences and silences
	- Non-western practices of knowing
	- Non-hegemonic perspectives of gender, ethnicity, and race
	- 
- Local and global communities
	- Projects speaking to under-represented geographies
	- Non-English 

### Open Access

- Projects that radically commit and promote Open Access
