# ScholComm Landscape

A list of projects that provide landscape analyses and reviews of the scholarly communication space usually breaking down the scholarly process into activities and contrasting it with a set of orthogonal dimensions.

- Publishing
- Scholarly Communication
- Education (LMS)

OER infrastructure will mostly overlap with publishing as one of the central tenets is the accessibility and availability of resources which often relies on independent and OA publishing tools.

For each review, we provide:

- some metadata
- a brief summary
- the subject of study
- categorization of resources (often broken down into the [[scholarly communication#Research Lifecycle \| research lifecycle]])
- analytic dimensions that were applied

## Publishing
