# Defining OI

An initial exploration of the conceptual frame of open infrastructures (OI) and how they map onto the landscape of projects.

From the [IOI website](https://investinopen.org/about/#defining-open-infrastructure-):

> We define _infrastructure_ as the systems, protocols, and software that research and scholarship rely on. _Open infrastructure_ further builds on that definition, looking at the narrower set of open source solutions that facilitate the creation and dissemination of open content, and empower communities to deliver new, improved collective benefits without restrictions to participation, engagement, or usage. These solutions are open source by design, employ open standards, are designed to interact and interoperate with other open services, and are governed by community needs. This frame is aligned with the definition of open infrastructures included in the text of the [UNESCO Open Science Recommendation](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000376893?posInSet=7&queryId=64f6c09b-9508-4258-82a1-e195d9d38368), which states that shared research infrastructures “_should be not-for profit and guarantee permanent and unrestricted access to all public to the largest extent possible.”_

Further more detailed criteria for the investigation of the hidden costs of infrastructure were specified in the [[Overview of IOI Work#Criteria \| mellon grant]].

### Research and scholarship

Activities related to four cycles of academic research:

- *Planning*. E.g., research discovery, literature management
- *Project*. E.g, data collection and storage, data analysis & computation
- *Publication*. E.g., submission, peer review, publishing
- *21st Century Digital Scholarship*. E.g., linking services, metrics, metadata services, data analytics
- *Education and learning*

#### Learning

What about education and learning as part of scholarship?

The learning infrastructure is quite interesting with big FOSS players managed by for-profit companies (e.g., Moodle, Canvas)

### Openness

> _Open infrastructure_ further builds on that definition, looking at the narrower set of open source solutions that facilitate the creation and dissemination of open content, and empower communities to deliver new, improved collective benefits without restrictions to participation, engagement, or usage. These solutions are open source by design, employ open standards, are designed to interact and interoperate with other open services, and are governed by community needs.

Away from pragmatic, technical understandings of openness (licenses, technical barriers) towards community
